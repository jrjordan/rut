# rut
A GIT repository for RUT (RAT Unit Tests) of small tests for the 
RAT (Reactor Analysis Tool) framework.

There are currently two macros: one for running events and one
for visualizing the detector. Analysis code goes in the analyze
directory.

This repository must be cloned into your ratpac-kpipe/data/
directory in order for it to work. Everything can be run from
this directory with no issues.
